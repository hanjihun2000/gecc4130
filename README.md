### Key Points
- Research suggests phone scam cases in Hong Kong increased significantly from 2019 to 2024, with a notable rise starting in 2020, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and increased digital engagement.
- It seems likely that telephone scam cases tripled from 3,213 in 2023 to 9,204 in 2024, with losses more than doubling, though early 2025 saw a 22% case increase but lower losses.
- The evidence leans toward improved awareness reducing average financial loss per case, especially with fewer mainland Chinese students affected in early 2025.

#### Summary of Findings
Phone scam cases in Hong Kong have shown a clear upward trend, particularly from 2020 onwards, aligning with the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on digital interactions. Data from news, official police websites, and the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre (ADCC) indicate a rise from 8,216 total deception cases in 2019 to 44,480 in 2024, with specific telephone scam cases jumping from 3,213 in 2023 to 9,204 in 2024. Financial losses for telephone scams increased from HK$1,102.8 million in 2023 to HK$2,911 million in 2024, but in the first five months of 2025, losses dropped to HK$430 million despite a 22% rise in cases (2,574 compared to 2,112 in the same period of 2024). This suggests a decrease in average loss per case, possibly due to better public awareness and fewer high-loss cases involving mainland Chinese students.

#### Analysis and Trends
The sharp increase starting in 2020 likely reflects the shift to digital communication during the pandemic, making it easier for scammers to target individuals. The tripling of telephone scam cases from 2023 to 2024, with losses more than doubling, highlights the growing challenge. However, the reduction in losses in early 2025, despite more cases, indicates potential success in awareness campaigns, particularly targeting vulnerable groups like mainland students, as noted in recent reports.

This data indicates a significant escalation in scam activities, particularly from 2020 onwards, with a notable focus on telephone scams in recent years. The reduction in losses in early 2025, despite increased case numbers, suggests evolving dynamics in scam impacts and victim responses.

#### Trend Analysis

##### Overall Deception Case Trends
The trend in total deception cases shows a consistent upward trajectory, with a particularly sharp increase from 2019 to 2020 (89.3% growth), likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The annual growth rates are detailed in the following table:

| Year       | Cases    | Growth from Previous Year | Percentage Growth |
|------------|----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 2019       | 8,216    | -                         | -                 |
| 2020       | 15,553   | +7,337                    | +89.3%            |

| 2024       | 44,480   | +4,656                    | +11.7%            |

The data highlights a significant jump in 2020, followed by sustained high growth rates until 2023, with a slowdown in 2024, suggesting possible stabilization or the impact of anti-scam measures.

##### Telephone Scam Case Trends
For telephone scams, specific data is available from 2023 onwards, showing a dramatic increase:

- From 2023 to 2024, cases rose from 3,213 to 9,204, a 186.4% increase, indicating a tripling in incidence.
- In the first five months of 2025, cases increased by 22% compared to the same period in 2024, suggesting continued growth but at a slower rate.

This trend aligns with the broader deception case increase, particularly post-2020, and underscores the escalating challenge of telephone-based fraud.

##### Financial Loss Trends
Financial losses for telephone scams also escalated significantly:

- From 2023 (HK$1,102.8 million) to 2024 (HK$2,911 million), losses more than doubled, reflecting the scale of financial impact.
- However, in the first five months of 2025, losses dropped to HK$430 million, a significant reduction compared to the estimated HK$1,290 million for the same period in 2024, despite more cases. This suggests a decrease in the average loss per case, potentially due to improved awareness and preventive measures.

#### Detailed Analysis and Insights

##### Impact of COVID-19
The sharp rise in deception cases from 2019 to 2020, particularly in telephone scams, coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced a shift to digital interactions. This period saw increased online activity, with more people working from home and relying on telecommunications, creating opportunities for scammers. Research, such as a study published in *Trends in Organized Crime* in February 2025, found that deception crimes increased during the pandemic, especially during periods of relaxed policies like eased lockdowns, suggesting that both isolation and increased digital engagement facilitated scam activities.

The sustained increase post-pandemic, as seen in 2023 and 2024 data, indicates a lasting impact, with scammers adapting to the new digital landscape. The user's observation of increased digital engagement during COVID-19 aligns with this, noting that it allowed scammers to easily trick people, particularly through phone-based methods.

##### Demographic and Vulnerability Factors
The data highlights specific vulnerabilities, particularly among mainland Chinese students, as noted in the South China Morning Post article from July 14, 2025. In early 2025, losses fell by almost two-thirds due to fewer cases involving these students, who typically lost larger sums. This suggests targeted awareness campaigns, especially ahead of the new academic year (August to October 2025), could be crucial. The decrease in average loss per case in 2025 (from HK$0.316 million in 2024 to HK$0.167 million in early 2025) supports this, indicating that while case numbers rise, the financial impact per victim is reducing, possibly due to better education and quicker reporting.

##### Effectiveness of Anti-Scam Measures
The reduction in losses in early 2025, despite increased cases, suggests that anti-scam measures are having an effect. The ADCC's role, as detailed in police press releases, includes disrupting deception, raising public awareness, and operating the Anti-Scam Helpline 18222, which handled 196,799 calls in 2023. Initiatives like the Anti-Deception Alliance (established November 2023 with 10 major banks) and the Scameter app, which issued nearly 360,000 alerts in 2023, likely contribute to reducing financial losses by enabling quicker interventions. The drop in losses, particularly among high-value targets like students, indicates these measures are beginning to yield results, as noted in the 2024 law and order situation report.

##### Comparative Financial Impact
The average loss per case analysis provides insight into scam dynamics:

| Year/Period          | Cases    | Losses (HK$ million) | Average Loss per Case (HK$ million) |
|----------------------|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 2023                 | 3,213    | 1,102.8              | 0.343                               |
| 2024                 | 9,204    | 2,911                | 0.316                               |
| 2025 (Jan-May)       | 2,574    | 430                  | 0.167                               |

The decreasing average loss per case, especially in early 2025, suggests scammers may be targeting more victims for smaller amounts, or that victims are recognizing and reporting scams earlier, reducing potential losses. This trend is particularly evident with the 45% year-on-year drop in cases involving mainland students in early 2025, as reported, contributing to lower overall losses.

#### Potential Research Directions

Given the data and trends, several research directions can be pursued for macro data analysis:

1. **Impact of COVID-19 on Scam Evolution:** Further investigate how the pandemic altered scam tactics, particularly the shift to digital platforms, and whether these changes are permanent. Analyze specific restrictions (e.g., lockdowns, travel bans) and their correlation with scam rates, using time series models like Auto ARIMA, as seen in academic studies.

2. **Demographic Vulnerability Analysis:** Examine which demographics are most affected, focusing on mainland Chinese students and other groups. Study socioeconomic factors, such as economic stress during the pandemic, that may increase vulnerability, and assess the effectiveness of targeted awareness campaigns, especially ahead of the 2025 academic year.

3. **Effectiveness of Anti-Scam Initiatives:** Evaluate the impact of law enforcement measures, such as the ADCC's interventions and collaborations with banks (e.g., Anti-Deception Alliance), on reducing scam losses. Analyze the role of technology, like Scameter and upstream scam interventions, in preventing fraud, and identify gaps in current strategies.

4. **Comparative Regional Analysis:** Compare Hong Kong's scam trends with other regions, such as Singapore or mainland China, to identify unique factors (e.g., digital adoption rates, regulatory frameworks) and best practices. This could involve analyzing global scam loss figures, such as the US$1 trillion reported at the Global Anti-Scam Summit Asia 2024, to contextualize Hong Kong's situation.

5. **Technological and Economic Factors:** Explore how advancements in AI and deepfakes, as seen in recent cases, are influencing scam tactics, and how economic conditions post-pandemic affect scam prevalence. Investigate the role of social media and online platforms in facilitating or mitigating scams, given their prominence in deception cases (70% Internet-related in 2023).

#### Conclusion

The analysis reveals a significant and ongoing increase in phone scam cases in Hong Kong, particularly from 2020 onwards, likely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on digital interactions. While case numbers continue to rise, recent data from early 2025 shows a promising decrease in financial losses, suggesting that awareness campaigns and preventive measures are beginning to mitigate the financial impact, especially among vulnerable groups like mainland Chinese students. Further research into demographic vulnerabilities, the effectiveness of anti-scam initiatives, and comparative regional trends can provide deeper insights for policy and public education efforts, particularly as Hong Kong navigates post-pandemic recovery and prepares for future challenges in scam prevention.
